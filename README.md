# Basket Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior to identify patterns and associations between products. The goal is to provide insights that can help improve sales and customer satisfaction.

## Overview

The project uses the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining, leveraging the power of pandas and mlxtend libraries in Python. It analyzes transaction data to discover frequent itemsets and association rules, revealing which products are often bought together.

## Features
- Utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and mlxtend.
- Conducts data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and Market Basket Analysis.
- Provides visualizations and interpretation of association rules and itemsets.
- Offers recommendations based on insights derived from the analysis.

## Contents
- *Code:* Codes written in python and detailing the analysis process step-by-step.
- *Documentation:* Includes a README.md file explaining the project, its objectives, and how to navigate through the code and analysis.
- *Datasets:* Any relevant datasets used for analysis (if allowed for distribution).


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can install required dependencies using pip install as required

## Usage

1. Load your transaction data into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Preprocess the data if necessary.
3. Apply the Apriori algorithm to discover association rules.
4. Visualize the results using various plots and charts.
